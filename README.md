Dramatically increase pallet storage capacity at production buildings, animal farms, and greenhouses! Instead of pallets spawning in a single layer, they now stack vertically and spawn in multiple rows.

WHAT THIS MOD DOES:
• Stacks pallets vertically up to 2 meters high (customizable up to 5m)
• Wool pallets: spawn 2 layers high
• Oil bottles: spawn up to 5 layers high
• Automatically doubles single-row spawn points into two rows when space permits
• Example: Grain Mill goes from 5 pallets → 30 pallets (5 × 2 rows × 3 layers)

COMPATIBLE WITH:
• All production buildings (bakery, grain mill, sawmill, oil mill, etc.)
• Animal husbandries that spawn pallets (chickens, sheep, bees)
• Greenhouses (all types)
• Most modded buildings (as long as they don't already have custom stacking)

CUSTOMIZATION:
A configuration file is automatically created in your modSettings folder on first use. This allows you to:
• Adjust maximum stack height globally or per-building
• Modify the retry attempts to spawn pallets (default 2 seconds)
• Enable/disable the double-row feature
• Fine-tune spawn positioning for specific buildings
• Add custom settings for modded buildings

IMPORTANT NOTES:
• For best results, clear existing pallets from spawn points before enabling this mod
• Existing pallets in spawn areas may not stack properly until the area is cleared
